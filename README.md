# GamyGames-LeanScale



### I used MVVM as the architecure of the app to avoid massvie view controllers and write testable code 

### I need to write unit tests for the app and do some enhancement regarding (animations)

### The UI is clean and good, Developing app for games is fun and trigger my gamming hobby that I had.

### The App is not ready to submit on the appstore 

### I really enjoyed working on this task.
